# What is this app for?

This app aims to demonstrate how to use Deepgram API to compute
talk time per speaker.

**WARNING**: This is an example application only designed for demoing. We
strongly discourage direct use of this code in production environnement.

# How can I deploy it?

You can "remix" this application on Glitch:

1. Create an API key in Deepgram, note down the secret.
2. Replace `INSERT_KEY_HERE` and `INSERT_SECRET_HERE`
   with this API key and secret in the following URL:
   > https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/dg-talk-time-analytics?PORT=3000&DG_KEY=INSERT_KEY_HERE&DG_SECRET=INSERT_SECRET_HERE

When accessing this URL in your browser, the project will be forked and deployed. Glitch comes with
an online editor so you'll have all the needed tools to play with your own app instance!
